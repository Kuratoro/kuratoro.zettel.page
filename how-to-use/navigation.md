title: How to navigate
---

We hope that you find it pretty straightforward to navigate the site. 

Here are some general guidelines: 

## Buttons

* All the navigation buttons are at the top left of the page (on mobile, they are at the bottom). From left to right (or left to right, on mobile):
  * Z-Index - displays all the notes in clusters
  * Edit - takes you to the Github source page where you can edit the note you're on
  * Search - takes you to the search page

## Navigating nearby zettels

* Scroll up (above the title) to see all the zettels branching off to the current zettel. It will be displayed in tree form.
* Backlinks that do not branch off to the current zettel (but only link to them) will be displayed at the bottom, if any.
