Specifics on linking notes.

Typically, you give each note a unique identifier, and create a link to the desired note.

Many Zettelkasten-aligned software have this function.

Examples:

1. Wiki style links[^1]
    - use double brackets to symbolize an internal link `[[noteID]]`
    - typically clickable, so you will be taken directly to the note
    - variations in symbols: `<>`

2. Manual linking
    - if the software you use doesn't support internal linking, you can set manual 'links' - a search function makes this much easier
    - you can use the same format as a wiki style link, or use any symbol you want
    - add the link, but since it is not clickable, you will have to copy and paste the ID into the search bar
