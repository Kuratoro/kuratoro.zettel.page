You may have taken and accumulated many notes in your lifetime, so what makes the Zettelkasten system different?

There are several differences including:

* The [[[types-of-notes]]] you include within it. You may be used to writing by topic, or in a linear fashion. In Zettelkasten, the notes are 'atomic', making them useable in various categories or topics.
* The way you write the notes. The focus is on making high-quality notes that are future-proof[^future].
* The emphasis on [[[linking]]] notes/ideas together. Linking ties the notes together so they become more useful.

See [[[other-uses]]] for related systems.

[^future]: Future-proof - notes that you will understand in the future without needing the same context in which you wrote them: https://zettelkasten.de/posts/how-to-write-notes-you-can-understand/
