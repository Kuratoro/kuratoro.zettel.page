You collected a whole bunch of articles and resources while reading, now, how can you organize them all?

To organize your references, you may consider including a reference management system into your workflow.

Methods include: downloading a reference manager, or creating a note for each reference.

## Academic References
- typically used with academic journal articles and books (or situations where you'd like to formally cite your references)
- a reference manager will make formatting these types of references much easier (ex. APA, MLA, Chicago styles)
- a citation key[^1] may be generated, so you can copy and search for the exact reference used
- an app like [Zettlr](https://docs.zettlr.com/en/academic/citations/) can even integrate with reference managers by using BibTex libraries
- you may still want to keep a separate folder of literature notes (see [[types-of-notes]])

### Reference Managers

- [Comparison List on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_reference_management_software)
- popular managers include: Zotero, Citavi, Mendeley
- you may have access to the paid reference managers through your academic institution, otherwise many of the software available are free

#### [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/download/)

- you can quickly add references if you know the ISBN, DOI, PMID, or arXiv IDs:

- you can download a [browser extension](https://www.zotero.org/download/) that can add and auto-populate fields

## Other options
- if you don't want to deal with a reference manager you can create your own system of managing them:
  - keep a separate folder with 'reference notes' - these can even be combined with literature notes (see [[types-of-notes]])
  - title each note/filename as a citation key[^1]
  - simply link to this note as needed
